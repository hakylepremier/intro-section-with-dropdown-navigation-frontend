## Overview

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- BEM Methodology
- [Pug JS](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - HTML Markup
- [Sass (Scss)](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Package bundler

### What I learned

I relearned how to add box-shadows in scss from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp):

```scss
.dropdown__menu {
	box-shadow: -1px 0 83px 0px tint($color-tertiary, 70%);
}
```

### Continued development

As it stands now, zooming in on the page is not possible. I'll look into using javascrit into bringiing that functionality back

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box Shadow](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp) - This is generating box shadows.
